# DESCRIPTION

A wrapper script to facilitate LEDE builds for my Linksys WRT3200ACM. The opkg list and the configuration files were created with [lede userpkgs](https://github.com/aasgit/lede-userpkgs)

## DISCLAIMER

Although I personally use this script regularly to automate builds for my WRT3200ACM, this script has not been tested throughly yet (especially: no other arch was ever tested/considered) and, anyway, its functionality might break pretty easily because of differences between LEDE versions. It is meant as both personal use and an itch to scratch. You are better off learning how to create your own 'sysupgrade.bin' image for your router. Read about it [here.](https://lede-project.org/docs/user-guide/imagebuilder)
